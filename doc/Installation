xbeeb Installation
==================

First off you'll need a copy of the OS1.2 ROM and a language ROM.  For the
emulated filesystem, the OS ROM needs to be patched.  See doc/RomPatches
for details on how to do that.

The ROMs are still under copyright, so I can't distribute them as part of
this package.  Careful searching for BBC Micro Emulator WWW sites will
no doubt help you out here, I'm sure.  For a start, I'd recommend
http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/bbc/

Then edit src/Config.h for your system.  In practice, you'll probably only
need to change the ENDIAN_6502 define, NEED_STRCASECMP, NEED_STRTOUL and
XBEEBROOT, which is the default location of the ROMs images and snapshots.

There is an Imakefile for the emulator.  To use it you need to do :

    $ cd src
	$ xmkmf -a
	$ make

( If your xmkmf doesn't support the "-a" flag, try :

    $ cd src
    $ xmkmf
    $ make depend
    $ make

That should work.)

It's possible that on HP-UX you may need to add -D_HPUX_SOURCE to the
CFLAGS variable.

To install the executable :

	$ make install

If you don't have xmkmf, there's a Makefile called Makefile.v which
may need a little doctoring before it will work.

The fonts will also need to be installed before the emulator will work.
There is no Imakefile for these (yet).  You should be able to do something
like :

	$ cd fonts
	$ for i in *.bdf
	$ do
	$ bdftopcf $i -o `basename $i .bdf`.pcf
	$ done

These files will then need to be installed somewhere where the X server
can find them.  A simple way to do this is :

    $ mkdir /new/font/directory
	$ cp *.pcf /new/font/directory
	$ touch /new/font/directory/fonts.alias
	$ mkfontdir /new/font/directory
	$ xset fp+ /new/font/directory/
	$ xset fp rehash

If you're running OpenWindows, then I'm not sure of the procedure, but
try starting with :

    $ for i in *.bdf
    $ do
    $ convertfont $i
    $ done
    $ bldfamily

The OS and language ROMs should be placed in XBEEBROOT/roms/...  By
default, the emulator will try to load OS1.2p1.rom (or OS1.2.rom if you
don't have the emulated filing system enabled) and BASIC2.rom when it
starts.  If you're using XDFS, which will be the default case, you need
to copy that to the same directory.

If you start up xbeeb and see:

BBC Computer 32K

No such variable


that's probably because it isn't loading the patched OS ROM.  See
doc/RomPatches for details and copy it into XBEEBROOT/roms as above.
