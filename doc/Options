Xbeeb Command Line Options
==========================

The following command-line options are supported :

	-o <filename>

	Loads the specified file as the OS.

	-p[slot] <filename>

	Loads the specified file as a paged ROM into the given slot (between 0
	and 15).  If no slot is given, then the default is to use slot 15.

	-w[slot]

	Makes the specified paged ROM slot writeable.  This effectively turns
	it into paged RAM.

	-d <directory>

	Sets the directory for the disk emulation.

	-V

	Display version and exit.

	-h, -?

	Give help on the command line options.

The emulator checks the specified filename and then XBEEBROOT/roms/<name>
for the OS and paged ROMs.  XBEEBROOT is defined in Config.h.
