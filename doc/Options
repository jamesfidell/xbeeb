Xbeeb Command Line Options
==========================

The following command-line options are supported :

	-o <filename>

		Loads the specified file as the OS.

	-p[slot] <filename>

		Loads the specified file as a paged ROM into the given slot
		(between 0 and 15). If no slot is given, then the default is 
		to use slot 15.

	-w[slot]

		Makes the specified paged ROM slot writeable.  This effectively
		turns it into paged RAM.

	-d <directory>

		Sets the directory for the disk emulation.

    -s <num>

    	Sets the keyboard DIP switches to <num>, which may be specified
		in octal, decimal or hex.  Only the LSB of <num> is used by the
		emulator, and the Beeb ignores all but the five least significant
		bits.

		The start-up MODE can be selected by setting the lowest three
		bits of this value (the bits representing the MODE number should
		be inverted first).  So

			xbeeb -s 0x5

		will start the emulator in MODE 2.

	-m <mode>

		Sets the screen MODE on startup.  This will override any setting
		made using the -s option.

    -a

    	When support is compiled in, enables the Model A machine emulation.

	-q

		Turn off sound

	-V

		Display version and exit.

	-h, -?

		Give help on the command line options.


The emulator checks the specified filename and then XBEEBROOT/roms/<name>
for the OS and paged ROMs.  XBEEBROOT is defined in Config.h.
