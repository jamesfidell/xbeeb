BBC Micro keyboard emulation
============================

Obviously these notes only apply to a UK/US keyboard -- it's been some
time since I had any experience of any other type.

There are a number of keys on the BBC Micro that do not work the same
way as a standard PC keyboard.  For instance :

    On the Beeb, shift-6 is ampersand (&), which is normally shift-7.

    Shift-7 on the Beeb produces a single right quote.

	The colon character is an unshifted key on the Beeb.  Not so on a PC --
	it's shift-semi-colon.  This also applies to the circumflex/caret/hat
	character, which is shift-6 on a PC.

	The equals sign is a shifted underscore on the Beeb and an unshifted
	key on a PC.

	The PC has no "COPY" key.  I have used the "Insert" key on the PC
	keyboard for this.

	Beeb function keys start at f0, PC ones start at F1.

    The "pound" symbol (that is, GBP, not the hash symbol) doesn't appear
    on anything other than a UK PC keyboard.

	The "Caps Lock" key under X acts as a toggle, not a push button.


Originally, I tried to get the characters entered at the keyboard to
correspond to the characters read by the Beeb, as far as possible. This
mean that in the cases where there is a conflict between the shift key
being up/down, the emulator tried to give the correct state of the shift
key as it would be seen on the Beeb, but the code could not be perfect
and in the case of games often lead of difficulty.

Other keys worked as follows :

    "Pause"		is the BREAK key
	"Left ALT"	is the SHIFT LOCK key
	"F10"		is the F0 key
	"End"		quits the emulator
	"Home"		creates a snapshot
	"Enter"		(on the keypad) allows a change of directory in the
				emulated filing system.
	"-"			(on the keypad) turns off instruction disassembly
	"+"			(on the keypad) turns on instruction disassembly

If there is no "Pause" key on your keyboard and X doesn't #define XK_Pause,
then F12 is used instead.

The code that implemented this is still available by #defining
KEYMAP_LEGEND in src/Config.h, because it may be more useful to use
when not playing games, or when playing games that involve lots of text
input.

To resolve some of the above problems, I finally adopted the approach of
trying to return the keys to Xbeeb that would be in that position on it's
keyboard.  This still isn't quite possible, but I've done the best I can.
My keyboard now works something like :



   ESC f1  f2  f3  f4  f5  f6  f7  f8  f9  f0

     @  1! 2" 3# 4$ 5% 6& 7' 8( 9) 0  -= ^~

     TAB Q  W  E  R  T  Y  U  I  O  P  [{ _£

          A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  ;+  :*  ]}

         \| Z  X  C  V  B  N  M  ,< .> /?

For the other keys,

    "Pause"		is the BREAK key
	"Right ALT"	is the SHIFT LOCK key
	"F10"		is the F0 key
	"Control"	is the CAPS LOCK key
	"Left ALT"	is the SHIFT key

	"End"		quits the emulator
	"Home"		creates a snapshot
	"Enter"		(on the keypad) allows a change of directory in the
				emulated filing system.
	"-"			(on the keypad) turns off instruction disassembly
	"+"			(on the keypad) turns on instruction disassembly

The reason for the strange arrangement of "Control" and "Left ALT"
for CAPS LOCK and SHIFT is that it avoids the problems of the way
that the Caps Lock key is handled as a toggle whilst retaining the
relative positions of these keys to make playing game such as Arcadians
more straightforward.  To use this keymap, #define KEYMAP_STRICT in
src/Config.h.

Again, F12 is used as a replacement for "Pause" should you not have that
key.

Note that the keyboard DIP switches can be set on the command line using
the -s option.

I've noticed that there are some problems using all of these keys on
(for example) a Sun keyboard.  If anyone has corrections or better
suggestions, I'll be glad to incorporate them.
