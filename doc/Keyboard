BBC Micro keyboard emulation
============================

Obviously these notes only apply to a UK/US keyboard -- it's been some
time since I had any experience of any other type.

There are a number of keys on the BBC Micro that do not work the same
way as a standard PC keyboard.  For instance :

    On the Beeb, shift-6 is ampersand (&), which is normally shift-7.

    Shift-7 on the Beeb produces a single right quote.

	The colon character is an unshifted key on the Beeb.  Not so on a PC --
	it's shift-semi-colon.  This also applies to the circumflex/caret/hat
	character, which is shift-6 on a PC.

	The equals sign is a shifted underscore on the Beeb and an unshifted
	key on a PC.

	The PC has no "COPY" key.  I have used the "Insert" key on the PC
	keyboard for this.

	Beeb function keys start at f0, PC ones start at F1.  Just use the
	keys as if F1 on the PC is f0.

    The "pound" symbol (that is, GBP, not the hash symbol) doesn't appear
    on anything other than a UK PC keyboard.


In the cases where there is a conflict between the shift key being
up/down, the emulator tries to give the correct state of the shift key
as it would be seen on the Beeb, but the code is not perfect.

Other keys work as follows :

	"End"		quits the emulator
	"Home"		creates a snapshot
	"Enter"		(on the keypad) allows a change of directory in the
				emulated filing system.
	"-"			(on the keypad) turns off instruction disassembly
	"+"			(on the keypad) turns on instruction disassembly
