Known Bugs
==========

There are probably plenty of bugs I don't know about, though I think
that the CPU emulation is good as long as you stick to legal, documented
opcodes. Here's a few problems I know about...

o The MODE 7 screen emulation flickers because it updates the whole
  screen when it changes, rather than just the changed bits, but I
  haven't worked out a suitable way to optimise that yet. The reason it
  works this way is because of the handling of double height characters
  -- the context of each line may change because of a change in the line
  above it.

o There are numerous places where I don't know how the emulator should
  handle a given situation. These are usually documented in the code,
  but will cause a fatal error if encountered.

o The cursor isn't implemented for bitmapped modes.

o Handling of mixed case in filenames is incomplete. If a filename is
  mixed case on the disk, it's exact name must be used in any command
  for loading or running it.

o The counter in Hopper is screwy.  I did have this working at once
  stage, but I've broken it again.

o Snapshots don't currently restore correctly.

o Games such as Elite, that use split-mode screens and/or reduced width
  displays don't work quite as perfectly as they might.  Some junk is
  left in the window and the mode doesn't always split quite where it
  should.


There must be other bugs, too, because otherwise all the software I have
would work properly, wouldn't it ?
