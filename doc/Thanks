Thanks to the following people, who have helped me along the way...

Daniel Piponi
	For help getting the proper colours working without having to
	create my own colourmap.

The BBC Micro mailing list
	For ideas, suggestions and shootings down in flames :-)

Messrs Bray, Dickens and Holmes
	who, with the odd error here and there, produced the Advanced User
	Guide for the BBC Micro, without which I wouldn't even have been able
	to start this.

Des Herriott
	who wrote such a good ZX Spectrum emulator (xzx) that I decided
	I had to do one for the Beeb.  Many's the time when we've drunk beer
	and talked emulators when we could have been doing something far
	more productive and far less fun.

Dave Thomas
	for not trying to break my arms and legs when I wanted to hack Xbeeb
	and he wanted to play Nethack.

James Murray
	for contributing the original sound code for Linux.

Rick Gough
David Ralph Stacey
	for bug-fixes, outstanding contributions (notably XDFS) and
	much-needed (on occasion :-) encouragement.

And let's not forget the numerous others who have helped with little
bits and pieces here and there.  You know who you are.  Thanks again.

Last, but far from least, I must thank my wife, Sarah, for her patience
and understanding.  Without those, xbeeb would have died a long time ago.
