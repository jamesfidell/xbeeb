Software that works properly under Xbeeb
========================================

This is a list of all the software I have tried to run on Xbeeb.  Anything
not here is untested by me.  In some cases, that's because I don't have the
software any more, in others, such as Elite, I have the software but can't
transfer it from BBC disk.

Some of the programs listed as not working can probably be sorted out with
trivial fixes -- mostly where the program writes to a register that I don't
have an emulation for yet (or just a value that I don't know how to handle),
or where there's an illegal op-code I could implement.  I expect to sort
these out in the next release.

If there's any other software that can be tested, please get in touch
with me (james@hermione.demon.co.uk).
