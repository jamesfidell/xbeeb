The Emulated Filing System
==========================

The emulated disk system (EFS.[ch]) requires a directory containing
a set of files present on a given disk, exactly as they would appear
on a BBC disk.  In addition, there's a file called "__CATALOG__"
which contains the name, load/execution address, length and sector
number for each file as it would be displayed by *INFO.

The sector number is unused in this emulation -- it's just there for
the sake of completeness.  In a future release, I may make the EFS
code more like the disk implementation, at which point the sector
number may become useful.

The emulation is not complete -- it's also not easy to implement all the
features the normal DFS. For example, *CAT displays the disk catalog in
the text window that Xbeeb was run from, not on the Xbeeb screen. The
other major problem at the moment is that, unlike the beeb, filenames
are case sensitive.

To "change" a "disk", press the "Enter" key on the keypad.  Xbeeb will
then display the current "disk" directory name and prompt for a new
one.  The "~" character may be used to represent $HOME and "+" may be
used to represent the compiled in value of XBEEBDISKS (in Config.h).

A demo "disk" is set up in the efs-demo directory.
