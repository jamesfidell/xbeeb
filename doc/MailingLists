Mailing lists
=============

The BBC micro mailing list has moved to bbc-micro@OiT.co.uk.  To subscribe,
send a message to bbc-micro-request@OiT.co.uk with the word "subscribe" as
the body of the message.  Send the word "help" as the body to the same
address for information about the mailing list.  I volunteered to take
this list over because it needed a new home.

The BBC micro emulators mailing list has moved to
beeb-emulators@OiT.co.uk. To subscribe, send a message to
beeb-emulators-request@OiT.co.uk with the word "subscribe" as the body
of the message. Send the word "help" as the body to the same address for
information about the mailing list.  This list just appeared to die
last year, possibly because it was run from a student account.  I'm
starting it up again.

The Xbeeb mailing list is at xbeeb@OiT.co.uk. To subscribe, send a
message to xbeeb-request@OiT.co.uk with the word "subscribe" as the body
of the message. Send the word "help" as the body to the same address for
information about the mailing list.
