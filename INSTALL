xbeeb Installation
==================

First off you'll need a copy of the OS ROM and a language ROM.

Then edit Config.h for your system.  In practice, you'll probably only
need to change the LITTLE_ENDIAN define and XBEEBROOT, which is the default
location of the ROMs images and snapshots.

There is an Imakefile for the emulator.  To use it you need to do :

	$ xmkmf
	$ make depend
	$ make

and finally, to install the executable :

	$ make install

If you don't have xmkmf, there's a Makefile called Makefile.v which
may need a little doctoring before it will work.

The fonts will also need to be installed before the emulator will work.
There is no Imakefile for these (yet).  You should be able to do something
like :

	$ cd fonts
	$ for i in *.bdf
	$ do
	$ bdftopcf $i -o `basename $i .bdf`.pcf
	$ done

These files will then need to be installed somewhere where the X server
can find them.

The OS and language ROMs should be placed in XBEEBROOT/roms/...  By
default, the emulator will try to load OS1.2.rom and BASIC2.rom when it
starts.
