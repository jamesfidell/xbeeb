Thanks to the following people, who have helped me along the way...

Daniel Piponi <dpdp19801@ggr.co.uk>
	For help getting the proper colours working without having to
	create my own colourmap.

The BBC Micro mailing list
The BBC Micro Emulator mailing list
	For ideas, suggestions and shootings down in flames :-)

Messrs Bray, Dickens and Holmes
	who, with the odd error here and there, produced the Advanced User
	Guide for the BBC Micro, without which I wouldn't even have been able
	to start this.

Des Herriott <des@doobie.demon.co.uk>
	who has written such a good ZX Spectrum emulator (xzx) that I decided
	I had to do one for the Beeb.  Many's the time when we've drunk beer
	and talked emulators when we could have been doing something far
	more productive and far less fun.

Dave Thomas <dave@hermione.demon.co.uk>
	for not trying to break my arms and legs when I wanted to hack Xbeeb
	and he wanted to play Nethack.
