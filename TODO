There's still a lot left to be done.  However, here's what's next on my
list :

o Use shared memory for the X11 windows.

o Add some representation of the keyboard LEDs to the window.

o Add buttons/windows for EFS disk changes.

o Allow the specification of the keyboard DIP switch settings on the
  command line.

o Some sort of sound emulation.

o Add a way of handling the "pound" key.

o Add a "BREAK" key.

o Add a "SHIFT LOCK" key.

o Allow configuration of a 16K Model A or 32K Model B.

o Set up a keymap to map Beeb keys to their positions on a PC keyboard.

o Add 65c02 support

o Add 65c12 support

o Fixed as many known bugs as possible.
